# Brannigan's Chess

"In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces." -Zapp Brannigan

## Running the Project

- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up`
- You should now see the service exposed on `localhost:8080`. Swagger for testing can be used on `localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
- The frontend is reachable at `localhost:3000`

## End of Development

The project is no longer in active development, and the backend is no longer deployed to save on costs. It can still be run locally.
